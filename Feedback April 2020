This is a list of feedback that was received on the April 2020 Model-T call. In no particular order.

1. What is the consquence of the security on what specific protocols? 
2. What about insider attacks and list of remedies? More network focused?
3. Consider designers who are working on different layers of the stack. Break down the stack and suggest protocol recommendations at different layers.
4. What protocol problems would you go back and fix based on these suggestions, espcially in recent standards?
5. What were the assets to protect? User data, users and etc as examples for updating protocols.
6. Look at metadata as a target on a network and also other assets like databases.
7. There is a cascading impact across not just one system, but multiple ones. Ensure a holistic approach.
8. Also show how absence of protocol design and updates leads to catastophy as well.
9. Focus on asset protection and defence in depth.
10. Create a list of asset descriptions.
